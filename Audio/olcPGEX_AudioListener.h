	|         OneLoneCoder Pixel Game Engine Extension            |
	|                    AudioListener v1.0                       |
	+-------------------------------------------------------------+

	What is this?
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This is an extension to the olcPixelGameEngine v2.16 and above.

	Its purpose is to allow audio integration into PGE which is
	compatible with Emscripten for Web applications also.

	Unlike my other extensions, this one requires some external
	libraries and additional setup (refer to github for instructions).

	In addition to the libraries the following files are required:

	olcPGEX_AudioListener.h      (this file)
	olcPGEX_AudioSource.h

	These can be found in the github repo as well...


	What it can do:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Play Audio!

	Using SDL2 as a backend and SoLoud as a frontend, this extension allows you
	to easily load and manipulate sound in a way that is cross platform and also
	has web support (using emscripten for PGE).

	In addition to the standard PLAY, PAUSE, and STOP controls you can also adjust
	VOLUME settings and MODULATION (playback speed).

	WAV and OGG are supported on most backends, however MP3 is also supported by
	SoLoud and SDL2 (even inside the web browser!).


	Limitations:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Requires SDL2, SDL2_Mixer, and SoLoud libraries be installed and linked
	successfully (detailed instructions on the github repo).


	How Does It Work?
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Once you have followed the setup instructions on the github repo and
	successfully compiled the test program you are ready to follow these
	instructions...

	Add the following includes underneath your olcPixelGameEngine include

		#include "olcPGEX_AudioListener.h"
		#include "olcPGEX_AudioSource.h"

	(Order matters here, they must be included exactly as above!)

	In your declarations add exactly (1) AudioListener

		olcPGEX_AudioListener AL{};

	
	(Note: Currently, only 1 instance of an AudioListener is permitted)

	Now add at least (1) AudioSource (you will eventually add many of these)

		olcPGEX_AudioSource AS_Test{};


	In the OnUserCreate function you must now initialise the AudioListener

		AL.AudioSystemInit();


	Next we can assign our AudioListener to our AudioSource and load an audio file

		AS_Test.AL = &game.AL;
		AS_Test.LoadAudioSample(1, "./assets/mus/Test.mp3");


	This assumes you have an MP3 file called "Test.mp3" in the listed folder in your
	project directory.  Also note the ID is set to "1" in this example. It is recommended
	that you assign labels to your audio files as IDs instead so you can more easily
	keep track of them. For example
	
		enum AUDIO
		{
			NULL_SND = 0, // used as a default case
			TEST_SND = 1,
			// add other sounds here
		};
		
		AS_Test.LoadAudioSample(TEST_SND, "./assets/mus/Test.mp3");

	This way you can easily refer to your sound without having to remember the integer
	value you assigned it in the beginning...
	

	Now all that is left to do is play the sound...

	In OnUserUpdate we can play / stop the sound using the SPACEBAR like so

		if (GetKey(olc::Key::SPACE).bPressed)
		{
			if (AS_Test.bIsPlaying)
				AS_Test.Stop();
			else
				AS_Test.Play();

		}


	Those are the basics... other features can be accessed in much the same way.

	Enjoy!
