# Animator2D Official Demo

What is this?
-------------
The source code to the demo found on YouTube here https://youtu.be/Fk7rt0563Io

How to use it?
--------------
Download the code files and add them to an empty cpp project... You will also need
to download the additional olcPGEX headers required for the project to work. They
are:

---------------------
olcPGEX_Animator2D.h

olcPGEX_SplashScreen.h

olcPGEX_ResourceManager.h

----------------------

They can be found in the main PGEv2_Extensions folder instead of with this demo to
ensure you always get the latest version.

And don't forget about the olcPixelGameEngine.h from the OneLoneCoder repo found here:

https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

Setup
-----
Now that you have all the required files in your project folder you simply need to
compile and run and you're good to go!
