# PGE GAME 2D
What is it?
-----------
A framework that allows quick initialisation and convenient access to ALL of my PGEXs greatly simplifying code requirements in your main game file.

It is essentially a BASE class to inherit from in addition to the olcPixelGameEngine which will implement the core game structure and other common elements that most games need in order to function.

What features does it have?
---------------------------
Resource management, Splash Screen, Smooth Scrolling / Clampable Camera, Complex Animation Control, Interactables (ie Menus), Screen Transitions, Ray Casting, Audio, Infinite Scrollable Tiles, State Machines, Intuitively Named Constants to replace ambiguous "true/false" and "magic numbers", Core Features / Game Loop Structure, etc...

How to use it?
--------------
Follow the instructions in the PGE_GAME_2D.h file. If not using audio or compiling for emscripten, you simply add the files to an empty project and you're good to go.  The instructions for Audio and Web deployment can be found in the AUDIO folder of my GitHub...

Enjoy!
